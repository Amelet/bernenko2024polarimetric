# Insect Diversity Estimation in Polarimetric Lidar

## Overview
This repository contains the data used in the study "Insect Diversity Estimation in Polarimetric Lidar" by Dolores Bernenko, Meng Li, Hampus MÃ¥nefjord, Samuel Jansson, Anna Runemark, Carsten Kirkeby, and Mikkel Brydegaard. Our research focuses on the identification of insects in flight using entomological lidar, a critical tool for ecologists to count and classify insects rapidly and non-intrusively.

## Research Objective
The primary aim of this study is to assess insect biodiversity using lidar technology. We analyze 32,533 observations of wild flying insects along a 500-meter transect, exploring the benefits of lidar polarization bands and the performance of clustering algorithms in species differentiation.

## Key Findings
- **Polarization Bands:** Analysis on the effectiveness of lidar polarization bands for differentiating insect species.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Comparative study of Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Gaussian Mixture Model in unsupervised clustering of lidar data.
- **Species Estimation:** Estimation of species count based on physical properties such as wing beat frequency, daily activity patterns, and spatial distribution.
